## Homework Instructions
Make sure that your app suits this basic spec:

* When adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following:
* Train Name
* Destination 
* First Train Time -- in military time
* Frequency -- in minutes
* Code this app to calculate when the next train will arrive; this should be relative to the current time.
* Users from many different machines must be able to view same train times.
* Styling and theme are completely up to you. Get Creative!
